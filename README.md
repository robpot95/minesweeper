## Minesweeper
We are going to try to replicate a game named minesweeper with Java. For more information about our group project can be found here: [Google Docs Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lJnSZtSOg6hWtYCW8S6HXRmjXOdSIQhw1YYbbPiL4LE/edit)

## Issues
We use the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/robpot95/minesweeper/issues). Keep in mind that everyone who is watching the repository gets notified by e-mail when there is activity, so be thoughtful and avoid writing comments that aren't meaningful for an issue (e.g. "+1").
